 **Abstract**: Existing literature suggests that family ownership (FO) reduces exploratory innovation (ERI). Contrary to this conventional view, some family firms are among the world's innovation leaders. Our study aims to reconcile this discrepancy by examining the role of restricted and extended socioemotional wealth in the relationship between FO and ERI. We posit that while FO may inhibit the capacity for ERI due to rigid mental models and cognitive convergence, it fosters the willingness for ERI owing to a long-term orientation. We argue that FO exhibits an inverted U-shaped effect on ERI. Empirical evidence from 938 Chinese-listed family firms between 2011 and 2021 supports our hypothesis. Our findings indicate that FO's influence on ERI is not uniformly detrimental and that a moderate level of FO can promote ERI. Additionally, the latter generational stage (GS) attenuates the inverted U-shaped curve, implying that family firms in the latter GS may exhibit lower levels of ERI. This study offers theoretical and practical insights into FO and technological innovation research domains.
