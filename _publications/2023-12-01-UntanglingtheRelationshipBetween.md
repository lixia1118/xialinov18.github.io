**Abstract**: The current literature has yet to reach a full consensus on the influence of corporate political ties (PT) on firm-level lowcarbon innovation (LCI). At one extreme, some literature argues that PT can improve access to government-controlled material innovation resources and provide firms with privileged information on existing or forthcoming innovation policies, thus facilitating LCI. At the other end of the spectrum, others suggest that businesses with PT may be vulnerable to rent-seeking activities and suffer reduced autonomy in innovation decision-making, which appears detrimental to LCI. To reconcile the debate, this study fused and extended insights drawing upon the combination of resource dependence, rent-seeking, and legitimacy theories and reasoned that both propositions may be correct over some range. As expected, we found that PT will exert a U-shaped effect on LCI. Also, it revealed that two facets of corporate reputation, namely, corporate prominence (i.e., being known) and generalized favorability (i.e., being liked), can enhance the curvilinear relationship. By collecting and analyzing a longitudinal panel dataset of 3425 firms from 2009 to 2018 drawn fromChinaâ€”the largest emergingmarket economy and the biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the world, strong evidence was found for our theoretical arguments and empirical hypotheses. Our study contributes to the literature on the curvilinear effects of political capital, the reputational contingency of PT, and more broadly, the relationship between corporate political activities and corporate environmental performance. Finally, our findings survived a series of rigorous robustness checks.
