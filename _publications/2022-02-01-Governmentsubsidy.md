**Abstract**: This study attempts to uncover the curvilinear relationship between government subsidies and corporate green
innovation in China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) industry, and investigate the moderating effect of board
governance within this relationship. Using a strong balanced panel data from all NEV firms that have acquired
government subsidy (GS) from 2013 to 2018, this study found government subsidy exhibit a U-shaped relationship
to corporate green innovation (CGI). It also reveals that some facets of board governance (BG) significantly
enhanced this U-shaped relationship, including board gender diversity, board age diversity, CEO duality
and board educational level. Our study specifically suggests that policymakers should incorporate such diversity
indicators as the proportion of female directors into investment evaluation standards (e.g. corporate governance,
environmental, social and governance, and sustainable investment), in order to promote environmental benefits
and societal equality and enhance women’s empowerment.
