**Abstract**: Previous studies revealed triple bottom line cannot entirely cover the concept of corporate sustainability. This
study thus uses sustainable resource management (SRM) to improve corporate sustainability (CS) performance
considering the socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficiency aspects. In this study, the vague set
(VS) theory and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method are integrated
as a hybrid decision-making tool by which social media data can be transformed into entropy weights.
The results indicate eco-efficiency and society should be prioritized to improve the corporate sustainability
performance. Specifically, the aspects should be promoted through encouraging environmental innovation, redesigning
consumers' offer, raising support of the institutions and policy measures, and organizing synergetic
involvement. The contributions of this study are three-fold: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for
guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment
data and social media information and address the interrelationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM
criteria to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.
