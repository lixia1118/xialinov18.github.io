**Abstract**: Through combining the resource dependence theory and social network theory, this study sheds light on how two major
kinds of interlocking network positions—central network position
and structural holes position—drive corporate low-carbon innovation.
We consider the mediating effect of information asymmetry
and knowledge absorptive capacity to reap benefits fromoccupying
the two advantageous network positions. We have empirically investigated
a sample of 3365 listed firms over the period of 2009–2018
drawn from China, the largest emerging market economy as well
as the biggest carbon dioxide emitter. Our main results show that
either holding a central network position or spanning a structural
holes position plays a significant role in stimulating low-carbon
technologies, and the promotion effect can be partially channeled
through downward information asymmetry and upward knowledge
absorptive capacity. Our findings differ from earlier work
because of our emphasis on network position, and our specific focus
on corporate low-carbon innovation and China’s unique setting,
rather than network size, greenhouse gas emissions, and developed
economies. This study also provides significant implications for
executives striving to improve firms’ low-carbon innovation performance,
and for policymakers seeking ways to fulfill the mission
of carbon dioxide abatement.
