I hold a Ph.D. in Business Administration with a specialized focus on <span style="color:blue">**Corporate Environmentalism**</span> in general. My research delves deeply into <span style="color:blue">**Corporate Green Innovation**</span>, <span style="color:blue">**Corporate Sustainability**</span>, and <span style="color:blue">**Corporate Social Responsibility**</span>.

I am particularly interested in:

- How firms overcome the path-dependency of non-green innovation when developing green innovation.
- The driving factors that encourage or discourage firms from developing green innovation.
- The (dis)advantages that green innovation brings to firms.
- How firms calibrate their green innovation strategies in the real world.
